		<h1>Partition of Bengal and Anti Partition Movement leading to the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement</h1>
		<p>The spread of Western education, the progress of vernacular press and patriotic literature, the economic exploitation of our country by the colonial rulers and international affairs led to the growth of political consciousness and a sense of nationalism among the Indians. As a result, various political associations were founded in different provinces were founded in different provinces by the educated Indians to put forward their various demands before the government. By 1880, the political leaders felt the need of an all India organization and then started negotiation with each other. <strong>Surendranath Banerjee</strong>organized a meeting of the Indian National Conferenceat Calcutta in 1883. Ultimately, the National Congress was founded in Bombay in 1885. This body became the vanguard of India's struggle for freedom.
		<br>
		The Congress leaders were known as Moderates because they followed a policy of prayer and petition. Their demands included all constituitional reforms. Thus slowly nationalism reached a new stage by the end of the 18th century.
		<br>
		India now had a large number of political leaders who had experience in political agitation. In England, the Liberal leaders like Gladstonewas no longer in power. The political situation had also changed. The new ruling group had no sympathy for opinion of the Indian people. They even tried to undermine those nominal concessions which had been conceded to the Indian people in the earlier period. Moreover, the increasing revolutionary tendencies in Maharashtra,Punjab and Bengal became a serious concern to the British Government. The situation became very critical when Lord Curzon, a staunch imperialist, became the Viceroy of India. He had no respect for the Indian National Congress.</p>

  			<section>
  				<p>Lord Curzon then wanted to ceush this body because Congress was the vamguard of Indian poltical agitation. A confrontation between lord Curzon and the educated middle class nationalists was inevitable. This eventually took place in Benga; where the leaders were more assertive and where Lord Curzon was at his offensive worst.</p>

  				<p>By the Municipality Act of 1899, Lord Curzon started his attack. By this Act, he reduced the number of elected members in the Calcutta Corporation. In this case, he served the interests of the European Business Community. this business community complained of delay in the grant of licence and similar other faciities. His next attack came down upon the Calcutta University when he passed the University Act of 1904. The pretext , he used was "to raise the standard of education all round". This Act reduced the number if elected Senate members, mostly Indian. A countrywide agitation against this Act thus started. <strong>The Down Society, founded in 1902, roused patriotic feelings among the youths.</strong></p>

			<summary><strong>Scheme of Partition</strong></summary>
				<p>The Presidency of Bengal had vast areas. Apart from Bengal proper, it originally comprised the whole of Bihar, Orissa and Assam. The British authority thought of reducing the size of the province for administrative convienience. Thus, Assam was separated from Bengal in 1874 and Sylhet, a predominantly Bengali-speaking area, was added to it. Actually, from the administrative point of view, some sort of territorial reorganization was needed. <strong>In 1903 Risley, Secretary, Home Department, Government of India</strong>, drafted a plan for partition of Bengal. Lord Curzon and Fraser, the then Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, favoured the Risley plan. Lord Curzon then toured Assam and East Bengal to mobilize support of the Muslims of theses areas for implementing the partitio plan. In his Dacca speech, Lord Curzon declared that his object was to revive the lost glory of the Muslims of the region. Earlier during his Assam tour in 1900, Lord Curzon received a memorial from the European tea planters suggesting the creation of a big province by linking up Assam with East Bengal and building a rail line to link Assam and Chittagong Fort. All these factors, worked at the back of his mind when Lord Curzon took decision for partition of Bengal.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Apart from this, the Britush civilians openly justified the partition plan of Risley for administrative convienience. They pointed out that:-</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Undivided Bengal was too large a province comprising Bengal, Buhar and Orissa. The population of the province was too large. This created problem for good administation.</li>
					<li>East Bengal is far away from Calcutta, the administative headquarters of the province. They were not in a position to tackle East Bengal from Calcutta.</li>
					<li>The cost of transporting tea from Assam to the Calcutta Port by rail became very expensive.</li>
					<li>The Muslims of East Bengal could not avail proper opportunities in the field of education and employment due to the domination of Hindus of West Bengal. If the partition was implemented, the Muslims of East Bengal, would get fair chance to improve their condition with a separate High Court, university, new capital at Dacca. Lord Curzon was convinced to use the plea of readjustment of territories to throttle the voice of the nationalists.This was a calculated move to hurt the Bengali speaking middle class who took the lead in the national movement. On July 20,1905, Lord Curzon announced the divisom of the province of Bengal inbto two provinces:-</li>
					<li>
						<ol>
							<li><section>Bengal-</section>It included the western districts of  Bengal proper, Buhar and Orissa with a poulation of 54 million. Calcutta was made its capital.</li>
							<li><section>Eastern Bengal and Assam</section>It included Dacca, Rajshahi, Chittagong divisions, the districts of Malda, Hill Tipperah and the province of Assam. With the Eastern districts of Bengal proper. Assam and Dacca as capital would form the new province Eastern Bengal and Assam. The scheme of partition was implemented on 16th Ocober, 1905.</li>

			<summary><strong>Motives Behind the Partition</strong></summary>
			<p>According to the British rulers, the partition was made for administrative necessity. But by this partition, Lord Curzon determined to hurt the Bengali-speaking middle class who took the lead in the National Movement. There were other reasons too:-</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the eyes of Lord Curzon, Bengal was the most vulnerable point in the entire British Indian Empire. Lord Curzon wanrted to crush the Congress and for this, his plan was to crush the nationalist solidarity in Bengal, because "Bengal united is a power, Bengal divided wil pull in several different ways...One of our main objects is to split up and thereby to weaken solid body of oppenents to out rule...That is perfectly true and is one of the merits of the scheme."</li>
				<li>The territorial readjustments should be made in a manner to make the Bengalees suffer physical as well as mental division. The importance of Calcutta had to be reduced, because, in Lord Curzon's opinion, Calcutta was the nerve centre of Anti-British Indian 	Nationalism. Calcuttan intellectuals and leaders like Surendranath Banerjee organized anti-British movement all over India. Bengalees regarded themselves as a great nation because of their wealth of vernacular literature. They were proud of the University of Calcutta and for the political radicalism of the middle class Bengalees. Once Bengal is divided, the Bengalee nationalism would receive a mortal blow.</li>
				<li>Lord Curzon and his advisers thus planned to take away those teritories where the Muslims were dominant and join those territories with Assam to form the new province. Lord Curzon also expected that the new province with Dacca as its capital, "would invest the Mohammedans in Eastern Bengal with a unity which they have enjoyed since the days of the old Mussalman Viceroys and Kings." Lor Curzon expected Dacca to acquire the special character of a provincial capital where Muhameddan interest would be strongly represented if not predominant. In this way Lord Curzon played this game to cripple the educated middle class nationalists of Bengal.</li>

			<summary><strong>Cambridge View about the Partition</strong></summary>
			<p>The Cambridge School of Historians have interpreted that opposition to partition scheme was made entirely by elitist interest groups. They hold the view that Lord Curzon partitioned Bengal for administrative reasons only and not for any political motive. The partition in any way did not affect the interests of the common people. The middle class elitist group whose interests were affected started the protest movement.For example, the middle class Babus of Vikrampore and East Bengal apprehended that the job opportunities for clerical and teachership posts would be squeezed by the creation of this new province. The Hindu Zamindars who had estates in both parts of Bengal would have to appoint two sets of agents would multiply. The lawyers of Calcutta apprehended to lose thier clients of East Bengal as a separate High Court would come up at Dacca. The Calcutta News Paper Owners also had the same apprehension that they would lose customers of East Bengal. The Roy family of Bhagyakul also feared that their monopoly trade in jute and rice would also suffer if Dacca and Chittagong became independent centre of trade. The East Bengal politicians felt that their chances of sitting in Legislative Council from those areas would be gravely curtailed. These feelings prompted the Bengalee middle class to start anti partition movement.</p>

			<summary><strong>Refutation of Cambridge View</strong></summary>
			<p>But the Rationalist Historians have rejected this interpretation of the Cambridge School of Historians on the following grounds:-</p>
			<br>
			<p>First, Lord Curzon and his bureaucrat officers did not partition Bengal ony for administative reasons. Their ultimate object was to crush the unity of Bengal politicians. In two letters dated 7th February and 6th December =, 1904, Herbert Risley, Lord Curzon's Honme Secretary, wrote, <strong>"Bengal united is a force, Bengal divided will go in different ways. That the Partition Plan is opposed by the Congress is its merit for us. Our principal motive is to weaken a united party against the Government."</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>Secondly, if Bengal becomes a separate province, Bengali speaking 16 milllion people of the Western people would become a minortiy under <strong>Hindi speaking people of Bihar and Oriya speaking of Orissa.</strong>If over population was the main cause of the partition, then the Hindi-speaking people of Bihar and Oriya speaking people of Orissa could easily be separated from Bengal. Surendranath Banerjee suggested this measure, but Lord Curzon was very adamant in this issue.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Thirdly, the bureaucrats expected that the protest would die down quickly. But very soon they were totally belied by events in Bengal and some other provinces.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Fourthly, Lord Curzon used the Muslim community in this political game to wreck the Anti British nationalism of the educated Bengali. Thus Lord Curzon encouraged the Nawab of Dacca to support his partition scheme by offering him 14 lakh as a political matter of great importance.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Fifthly, idealism had a great place in the protest against partition.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Lastly, it was also true that the material interests of a large section of Bengalee middle class apart from the elite group were also affected by this partition.</p>

			<summary><strong>Anti-Partition Movement: Swadeshi and Boycott</strong></summary>
			<p>The actual partition was given effect on 16th October 1905 by breaking up Bengal and its 41.2 million Bengali speaking people. The anti partition movement started in Bengal on the convention Moderate line. The anti partition movement crystallised into four phases.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>In the first phase</strong>,16th October was observed as a day of hartal. People of all sections of the society walked bare footed and took bath in the River Ganga. The people started walking and singing the famous song "Banglar Mati, Banglar Jal" composed by Rabindranath Tagore particularly for this occasion. The people observed Raksha Bandhan by tying of threads between Hindus and Muslims as a mark of brotherhood. Arandhan, that is, keeping the hearth unlit, was also observed as a mark of protest. A big conference was arranged at Calcutta Town Hall where speakers, one after another, expressed their feelings and injured sentiments against the partition. The Muslim leaders like Abul Kashem, Din Muhammad, Dadar Box, and Liyaqat Hussian joined the protest movements. Ananda Mohan Bose laid the foundation stone of the Federation Hall and in that ceremony people took the vow to resist the partition at all cost. The journal Bengalee edited by Surendranath Banerjee, published leading article under the caption, " A Grave National Disaster". A number of public meetings were held in different parts of Bengal to protest against the partition. The British Indian Association, the Bengal Landholders' Association submitted memorials against the move of the government. A mammoth representation with the signatures of about 7000 people of all classes and communities of East Bengalwas submitted to the Secretary of State. Even the Dooars' planters protested against it. The Calcutta High Court was also against the partition and characterized it as 'retrograde and mischievous step'. The English press in India like Englishman, Statesman and Pioneer at first strongly condemned this measure.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>In the second phase</strong>, the Atma Sakti or 'Self Help' movement started. Rabindranath Tagore, Aswini Kumar Dutta and other leaders appealed to the Bengalee nation to start Atma Sakti or Self Help. Rabindranath Tagore now asked the countrymen to organize constructive activities like vernacular education, social reform, village organization and others in this article "Swadeshi Samaj". <strong>Satish Chandra Mukherjee thus founded the Dawn Society to give effect the idea of national education. Aswini Kumar Dutta founded the Braja Mohan College at Barishal(Now in Bangladesh), Sir P.C.Roy and Dr. Nil Ratan Sarkar now opened indigenous factories and trading societies.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>In the third phase,</strong>the anti partition movement became a passive resistance movement against the British government through 'Boycott and Swadeshi'. The Boycott was the negative and Swadeshi was the constructive aspect of the movement. The Moderate policy of constituitional protest had no effect on the indifferent attitude of the authorities both in India and Britain. Lord Curzon said, "Partition of Bengal is a settled fact and what is settled cannot be unsettled."</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Bipin Chandra Pal in his 'New India'</strong>made a strong critcism of the petition and prayer policy of the Moderates for the revocation of the partition.<strong>In his famous pamphlet 'New lamps for the Old', Aurobindo Ghosh appealed to the people to rally for forging powerful active movement.</strong>He declared in 1907, "This movement is no mere a protest against ill government of the Raj. This movement is now directed against the Raj and seeks its end. It must go". In the column of Bande Mataram, Aurobinda gave the battle cry "Abolish British Rule in India". Bramhovandhabh Upadhya also rebuked the Moderates for their petition technique.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Thus, the Moderate line of protest did not succeed. The leaders now started searching for new methids and new techniques.<strong>Krishna Kumar Mitra, the editor of the journal Sanjivani in its issue of 13th July, 1905, first suggested the idea of Boycott of British goods, schools and colleges founded by the Government and shunn all contacts with the government and all official bodies.</strong>Another important leader<strong>Lal Mohan Ghosh</strong>expressed the hope in Amrita Bazar Patrika that boycott of british cotton goods would create havoc on the Manchester cotton mills of England. The news papers like the Bande Mataram, Sandhya and Yugantar supported the boycott proposal. Finally, at a vast public meeting at Town Hall Calcutta, the boycott proposal was accepted.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>In the fourth phase,</strong>the student volunteers now took the lead and they started picketing before the shops that sold British goods. For spreading the message of Boycott and Swadeshi, a large number of volunteer organizations sprang up in Calcutta and in Eastern Bengal. Some of them were <strong>Brati Sangha</strong> , <strong>the Swadeshbandhav</strong>, <strong>the Anusilan, the Sadhana, Suhrid</strong>and others. In the districts, Saha community become the target because they refused to accept the demand of boycott of foreign goods. The students shouted Bande Mataram and came out of the schools. The Government also took repressive measure against the students who participated in the movement. A number of students were fined, expelled from schools and colleges; sometimes they were beaten by the police with lathis. Government grants were withdrawn of those instituitions whose students participated in the agitation movement. Though some leading nationalist Muslim leaders took part in the boycott movement, the Muslims in general remained aloof. The lawyers boycotted courts where English laws were operated. Doctors, teachers, government officials and workers refused to work for the British government.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The people were now offered indigenous goods in lieu of british goods. The famous folk singers Mukunda Das, Bhusan Das, and Mufizuddi Bayati preached the idea of Swadeshi in rural areas of East Bengal through their patriotic songs and theatrical performance.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Satis Chandra Mukherjee now started to implement his plan of national education through the Dawn Society. Aurobindo Ghosh resigned from the post of Principal of Baroda College and accepted the post of Principal of the National College. During this time, the Bengal Technical Institute was founded. This is known as the Modern Jadavpur University.</p>
			<br>
			<p>A number of industries like Calcutta Potteries, Bengal Chemicals, Banga Lakshmi Cotton Mills, Mohini Mill and National Tannery was started. Apart from these, many soap, match box, tobacco manufacturing establishments, oil mills, Swadeshi banks , Insurance Companies were also opened as a result of the Swadeshi movement. Rabindranath Tagore also encouraged initiating a number of Swadeshi stores.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This movement encouraged a flow of nationalist and patriotic literature. Patriotic songs were composed by Rabindranath Tagore, Rajani Kanta Sen, Dwijendralal Roy, Girindramohini Dasi, Syed Abu Mohammad and others. Patriotic dramas were also written by personalities like Girish Chandra Mohan, Amritalal Bose, Khirodprasad Vidyavinode and others.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>In the fifth phase,</strong>the anti partition movement took the character of revolutionary terrorism. The brutal repression, torture on the innocent people drove a section of the youth to the path of revolutionary terrorism under the inspiration of Aurobindo and his brother Barindra Ghosh. The revolutionary leaders now planned to murder the repressive officers and magistrates. They expected that the morale of the oppressive British officers would be brokwn by such murders.</p>

			<summary><strong>Assessment of the Swadeshi Movement</strong></summary>
			<p>The partition of Bengal and the subsequent Swadeshi movement constitute an important chapter in the history of the freedom movement in India.<strong>"Though the movement started with a bang, it ended with a whimper"</strong> remarked <strong>Amalesh Tripathy</strong> There were a number of causes for the failure of the movement.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The ruthless expression, iron handling by the Authority, indiscriminate lathi charge =, arrest and imprisonment broke the moraleof the volunteers and the picketers. The police forcibly dispersed the Barisal Conference of 1904 and brutally beat up a large number of partcipants.</li>
				<li>The split in the Surat Congress in 1907 greatly weakened the movement from inside.<strong>Bipan Chandra thinks that the rest of the country was not prepared tp adopt the new style and techniques.</strong></li>
				<li>Another important fact was that there was a sudden vacuum of leadership. Bipan Chandra has mentioned between 1907 and 1908, nine important leaders of the movement including Aswini Kumar Datta and Krishna Kumar Mita of Bengal were deported. Tilak was given six year's imprisonment while Ajit Singh and Lala Lajpat Rai of Punjab were also deported. Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh of Bengal retired from active politics and almost in one stroke, the entire movement became leaderless.</li>
				<li>The movement was mainly confined to the middle class people. The mass character of the movement suffered a setback due to absence of the peasants and working class people. The leaders of the Swadeshi Movement did not try to rally the peasants' imagination. There was a lack of genuine interests among the leaders in formulating concrete programmes for the betterment of the peasants. The leaders of the movement never raised any voice against the peasants' burden of debts, their periodic eviction from the land or against their continued subjection to unpaid forced labour. No leader gave any call for launching an agitation on the issues of exorbitant tax and rent. <strong>Sumit Sarkar considers it as the fundamental weakness of the movement.</strong></li>
				<li>The Muslim peasants of East Benga did not join the movement because the Hindu Zamindars forced them to boycott foreign cloth against their will. The British cloth was cheaper while native handloom and mill products were expensive. The boycott movement failed because the suppky was inadequte than demands of the people. Moreover, Salimullah Khan, the Nawab of Dacca, and his supporters strongly opposed the Swadeshi and Anti Partition Movement.</li>
				<li>The narrow Hindu character of the Swadeshi Movement also made the general Muslims indifferent towards the movement. The glorification of Hindu past, the practice of taking pledge of Swadeshi before a Hindu deity, the vow of self sacrifice before the goddess Kali, the constant reference to the Gita, the observance of Birashtami, the use of images of Hindu goddess on public platformsand the insistence on the goddess Durga, the eternal spirit of the Bengalees, thus kept the Muslim people away from the movement. Such Hindu revivalist propaganda made the movement weak from the very beginning. The leaders of the movement failed to understand that India has a composite culture. It is a land where Hindu and Muslims live sdie by side as brothers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Fina;;y, the movement declined because of the very logic of mass government itself. <strong>In the opinion of Bipan Chandra, a movememt cannot sustain endlessly at the same pitch of militancy and self sacrifice, especially when faced with severe repression. As the movement turned to the path of terrorism, it lost open contact with the people.</strong>
